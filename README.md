 Case Study: Data-Driven Sales Optimization in the Automotive & Motorcycle Industry

In a competitive and fast-changing market, companies in the automotive and motorcycle sector must rely on data to drive smarter decisions. This project analyzes sales data across multiple regions, customer segments, and product types (cars and motorcycles) to uncover actionable insights.

By examining key metrics such as units sold, sales value, geographic distribution, and customer behavior, we aim to:

📍 Identify top-performing products and regions

👥 Spot high-value customers

📊 Understand deal sizes and pricing strategies

📆 Detect sales trends over time

Using SQL for data transformation and Power BI for visualization, this project transforms raw sales data into a clean, interactive dashboard that helps business stakeholders track performance and make informed, data-driven decisions.

## The Process

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and initially downloaded as a CSV file. Since the raw data required significant cleaning and normalization, it was first reviewed and modified in Google Sheets. This included correcting inconsistent data types, formatting numerical columns appropriately, and ensuring date values were properly structured.
