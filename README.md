## Case Study: Data-Driven Sales Optimization in the Automotive & Motorcycle Industry

In a competitive and fast-changing market, companies in the automotive and motorcycle sector must rely on data to drive smarter decisions. This project analyzes sales data across multiple regions, customer segments, and product types (cars and motorcycles) to uncover actionable insights.

By examining key metrics such as units sold, sales value, geographic distribution, and customer behavior, we aim to:

*  Identify top-performing products and regions

* Spot high-value customers

* Understand deal sizes and pricing strategies

* Detect sales trends over time

Using SQL for data transformation and Power BI for visualization, this project transforms raw sales data into a clean, interactive dashboard that helps business stakeholders track performance and make informed, data-driven decisions.

## The Process

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and initially downloaded as a CSV file. Since the raw data required significant cleaning and normalization, it was first reviewed and modified in Google Sheets. This included correcting inconsistent data types, formatting numerical columns appropriately, and ensuring date values were properly structured.

## 1. Data Cleaning & Type Correction in SQL Server
* **Data Types Standardized**: After importing the data into SQL Server, string columns containing numeric values (e.g., sales, price_each, order_number, quantity_ordered) were converted to appropriate types such as **FLOAT** and **INT**, ensuring accurate aggregation and filtering.

* **Date Handling**: Converted text-based date columns into the **DATE** type to allow time-based analysis and sorting.

* **Null Handling**: Filled or replaced missing values in columns like state.

## 2. Data Modeling (Star Schema)
To optimize the dataset for analytical queries, a star schema model was designed. This structure simplifies the querying process and improves performance in Power BI.

### **Fact Table**:  
 
**FactSales** - Contains core transactional data: Order number, Quantity ordered, Price each, Sales value, Deal size, Orderline number, Foreign keys to dimension tables

### **Dimension Tables**:  

**DimDate** â€“ Contains one row per calendar day (used for time-series analysis). Includes fields like DateID, OrderDate, Year, Quarter, Month, and MonthName.
The teble was created using SQL to enable flexible and accurate time-based analysis (e.g., group by quarter, year, etc.), which is not possible with raw date fields alone.

**DimCustomer** Contains â€“ Unique customers and their contact names.

**DimProduct** Conatins â€“ Products, product lines, and MSRP values.

**DimLocation** Contains â€“ City, state, territory.

This star schema promotes data integrity, efficient joins, and allows for clear slicing and filtering in Power BI.

## 3. Power BI Development
In Power BI Desktop, I connected directly to the cleaned and structured SQL database to create an interactive and insight-driven dashboard available for business users and decision-makers.
The report was developed to provide a comprehensive and interactive view of sales performance across customers, products, and geographical regions.

### **Key Metrics:**   


**Customer Count**: Displays the number of unique customers  

**Total Products Sold**: Reflects the total quantity of products sold, indicating sales volume.

**Total Revenue**: Captures the overall sales revenue, representing business growth and profitability.

**Total Orders**: Showing total of orders made for the specified period

### **Visualizations & Insights:**   
**Monthly Revenue (Area Chart)**: Visualizes sales trends over time

**Revenue by State (Donut Chart)**: Highlights the top three states by revenue

**Top 5 Customers (Bar Chart)**: Identifies the highest revenue-generating clients

**Top 3 Products (Pie Chart)**: Showing best-selling products  




Each visual is fully interactive and dynamically filters data by year (2003, 2004, 2005) through a slicer.

The second page of the report focuses on geographic insights. Selecting a specific country from the slicer dynamically updates the table to display total revenue broken down by year, quarter, and month. The table also includes prior year revenue. Additionally, the table shows the Year-over-Year (YoY) percentage change alongside a visual indicator that clearly highlights whether the change is positive or negative.

Two visualsâ€”a gauge and a pie chartâ€”display the revenue and order share of the selected country, dynamically updated via a country slicer for comparison against all countries. A map is also included to highlight the selected region geographically.
